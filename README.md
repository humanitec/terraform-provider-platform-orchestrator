# Terraform Provider Humanitec V2

This repo holds the source code for the Platform Orchestrator terraform provider by Humanitec. This allows organizations to configure all platform engineering concerns through infrastructure as code.

## License

MIT Licensed.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.23

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Using the provider

See [humanitec/platform-orchestrator](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/humanitec/platform-orchestrator/latest) in the Terraform Registry or [humanitec/platform-orchestrator](https://search.opentofu.org/provider/humanitec/platform-orchestrator/latest) in the OpenTofu registry. 

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `make generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```
